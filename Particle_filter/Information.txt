This folder contains all functions for running the particle filter and smoothing algorithm explained in the article:
'ECG-based beat-to-beat assessment of AV node conduction properties during AF'.

PF is an acronym for particle filter, and the functions starting with PF are thus related to the particle filter.

The smoothing algorithm is in the function 'PF_smoothing'.

The functions 'Z_matrix', 'phase', and 'signalquality_updated_mikeal_fixed_MK' are related to the article with DOI 10.3389/fphys.2022.976925.


To run the PF and smoothing algorithm using EGM data, run the script 'Main_known.m'. 

To run the PF and smoothing algorithm using ECG data, run the script 'Main_unknown.m'.

To run the model on a Linux or Mac, you have to mex the file 'Model_PF' by running the following command in Matlab:
mex Model_PF.cpp
