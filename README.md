Research and development by Mikael Wallman, Mattias Karlsson, and Frida Sandberg.

This repository contains the code related to our article: "Non-invasive characterization of human AV-nodal conduction delay and refractory period during atrial fibrillation".

The content is as follows:

\AV_node_model.cpp
The model code 

\Example_Script.m
An example of how to run the code in Matlab.
